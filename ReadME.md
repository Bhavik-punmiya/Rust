## Introduction

In this repository, I document my journey of learning Rust programming language. I explore various concepts, techniques, and best practices to build reliable and efficient software using Rust.

## Getting Started

To get started with Rust, you need to install the Rust programming language. You can find detailed installation instructions in the official Rust documentation [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Concepts

This section covers the fundamental concepts of Rust that I have learned. It includes topics such as variables, data types, control flow, functions, error handling, and more.

## Examples

In this section, I provide practical examples that demonstrate the concepts discussed in the previous section. Each example includes code snippets and explanations to help you understand how to apply the concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Contributing

If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions are always welcome!
